Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a virus, the severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The first known case was identified in Wuhan, China, 
in December 2019.[7] The disease quickly spread worldwide, resulting in the COVID-19 pandemic.

Symptoms of COVID‑19 are variable, but often include fever,[8] cough, headache,[9] fatigue, 
breathing difficulties, loss of smell, and loss of taste.[10][11][12] Symptoms may begin one 
to fourteen days after exposure to the virus. At least a third of people who are infected do not 
develop noticeable symptoms.[13] Of those people who develop symptoms noticeable enough to be 
classed as patients, most (81%) develop mild to moderate symptoms (up to mild pneumonia), 
while 14% develop severe symptoms (dyspnoea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement on imaging), 
and 5% develop critical symptoms (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan dysfunction).[14] Older 
people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms. Some people continue to experience a range 
of effects (long COVID) for months after recovery, and damage to organs has been observed.[15] 
Multi-year studies are underway to further investigate the long-term effects of the disease.[15]

COVID‑19 transmits when people breathe air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles
containing the virus. The risk of breathing these is highest when people are in close proximity, 
but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors. Transmission can also occur 
if splashed or sprayed with contaminated fluids in the eyes, nose or mouth, and, rarely, via contaminated
surfaces. People remain contagious for up to 20 days, and can spread the virus even if they do not 
develop symptoms.[16][17]

COVID-19 testing methods to detect the virus's nucleic acid include real-time reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (rRT‑PCR),[18][19] transcription-mediated amplification,[18][19][20] and 
reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT‑LAMP)[18][19] from a nasopharyngeal 
swab.[21]

Several COVID-19 vaccines have been approved and distributed in various countries, which have 
initiated mass vaccination campaigns. Other preventive measures include physical or social distancing, 
quarantining, ventilation of indoor spaces, covering coughs and sneezes, hand washing, and keeping 
unwashed hands away from the face. The use of face masks or coverings has been recommended in public 
settings to minimise the risk of transmission. While work is underway to develop drugs that inhibit 
the virus, the primary treatment is symptomatic. Management involves the treatment of symptoms, 
supportive care, isolation, and experimental measures.
